# Tiago Silvestre Condeixa

I’m a **Software Engineer** with a broader experience in **Infrastructure** and **Cloud**.
I enjoy to design, implement and deliver **simple solutions** related with
the **development lifecycle** and **infrastructure**,
always having a focus on aspects related to governance, availability, scalability and reliability.
I'm looking for challenges and opportunities to **learn**, so I found very interesting the
possibility to integrate new technologies or tools in the system
whenever bring business or technology advantage.
